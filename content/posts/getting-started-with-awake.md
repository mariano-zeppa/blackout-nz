# Description

* Blackout Sessions is back!
This time, we're hosting a secret blackout rave to welcome our friend Thomas who was stuck overseas for almost a year during the COVID-19 pandemic. Weâ€™ll make a plan to get him to the venue without him knowing. We will bring him at a specific time, which will be confirmed later - so make sure to come before that so you can be part of the surprise.
Please DONâ€™T TELL HIM or mention anything about the party!
Bring your friendly vibes along and letâ€™s dance through a special evening featuring local and international artists of subliminal beats at RedBar.
